                <h2 id="m716">Preamble</h2>
                <p>With the following privacy policy, we would like to inform you about the types of your personal data (hereinafter also referred to as "data" for short) that we process for which purposes and to what extent. The privacy policy applies to all personal data processing carried out by us, both in the context of providing our services and, in particular, on our websites, in mobile applications, and within external online presences, such as our social media profiles (hereinafter collectively referred to as "online offer").</p>
                <p>The terms used are not gender-specific.</p>

                <p>Last changed: ... ...</p><h2 id="m3">Contact Information</h2><p>... ...</p>
                <p>E-mail address: <a href="mailto:"></a>... ...</p>

                <h2 id="mOverview">Overview of Processing</h2><p>The following overview summarises the types of data processed and the purposes of their processing and refers to the data subjects.</p><h3>Types of data processed</h3>
                <ul><li>Usage data.</li><li>Meta, communication and procedural data.</li><li>Log data.</li></ul><h3>Categories of data subjects</h3><ul><li>Users.</li></ul><h3>Purposes of processing</h3><ul><li>Security measures.</li><li>Provision of our online offer and user-friendliness.</li><li>Information technology infrastructure.</li></ul><h2 id="m2427">Relevant Legal Bases</h2><p><strong>Relevant legal bases under the GDPR: </strong>Below you will find an overview of the legal bases of the GDPR on which we process personal data. Please note that in addition to the provisions of the GDPR, national data protection regulations may apply in your or our country of residence or domicile. Should more specific legal bases be relevant in individual cases, we will inform you of these in the privacy policy.</p>
                <ul><li><strong>Consent (Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. a) GDPR)</strong> - The data subject has given consent to the processing of personal data concerning him or her for one or more specific purposes.</li><li><strong>Legitimate Interests (Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f) GDPR)</strong> - processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a third party, except where such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require protection of personal data.</li></ul><p><strong>National data protection regulations in Germany: </strong>In addition to the data protection regulations of the GDPR, national regulations on data protection apply in Germany. These include in particular the Act on Protection against Misuse of Personal Data in Data Processing (Bundesdatenschutzgesetz â€“ BDSG). The BDSG contains in particular special provisions on the right to information, the right to erasure, the right to object, the processing of special categories of personal data, processing for other purposes and transfer, and automated individual decision-making, including profiling. Furthermore, state data protection laws of the individual federal states may apply.</p>
                <p><strong>Reference to the validity of the GDPR and the Swiss FDPA: </strong>These data protection notices serve both to provide information in accordance with the Swiss Federal Data Protection Act (FDPA) and the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). For this reason, please note that the terms of the GDPR are used due to their broader spatial application and comprehensibility. In particular, instead of the terms "processing" of "personal data", "overriding interest" and "particularly sensitive personal data" used in the Swiss FDPA, the terms "processing" of "personal data" as well as "legitimate interest" and "special categories of data" used in the GDPR are used. However, the legal meaning of the terms will continue to be determined in accordance with the Swiss FDPA within the scope of the Swiss FDPA.</p>

                <h2 id="m27">Security Measures</h2><p>We take appropriate technical and organisational measures in accordance with the legal requirements, taking into account the state of the art, the implementation costs and the type, scope, circumstances and purposes of processing as well as the different probabilities of occurrence and the severity of the threat to the rights and freedoms of natural persons, in order to ensure a level of protection appropriate to the risk.</p>
                <p>The measures include, in particular, safeguarding the confidentiality, integrity and availability of data by controlling physical and electronic access to the data, as well as access, input, disclosure, securing availability and separation relating to them. Furthermore, we have established procedures that guarantee the exercise of data subject rights, data erasure and responses to data threats. Furthermore, we already consider the protection of personal data during the development or selection of hardware, software and procedures in accordance with the principle of data protection, through technology design and through data protection-friendly default settings.</p>
                <p>Securing online connections using TLS/SSL encryption technology (HTTPS): To protect user data transmitted via our online services from unauthorised access, we use TLS/SSL encryption technology. Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS) are the cornerstones of secure data transmission on the Internet. These technologies encrypt the information transmitted between the website or app and the user's browser (or between two servers), protecting the data from unauthorised access. TLS, as the more advanced and secure version of SSL, ensures that all data transmissions meet the highest security standards. When a website is secured by an SSL/TLS certificate, this is indicated by the display of HTTPS in the URL. This serves as an indicator to users that their data is transmitted securely and encrypted.</p>

                <h2 id="m25">Transfer of Personal Data</h2><p>In the context of our processing of personal data, it may happen that data is transferred to other bodies, companies, legally independent organisational units or persons or disclosed to them. The recipients of this data may include, for example, service providers commissioned with IT tasks or providers of services and content that are integrated into a website. In such cases, we comply with the legal requirements and in particular conclude corresponding contracts or agreements with the recipients of your data that serve to protect your data.</p>

                <h2 id="m24">International Data Transfers</h2><p>Data processing in third countries: If we process data in a third country (i.e. outside the European Union (EU), the European Economic Area (EEA)) or processing takes place in the context of the use of third-party services or the disclosure or transfer of data to other persons, bodies or companies, this only takes place in accordance with legal requirements. If the level of data protection in the third country has been recognised by means of an adequacy decision (Art. 45 GDPR), this serves as the basis for the data transfer. Otherwise, data transfers only take place if the level of data protection is otherwise guaranteed, in particular by standard contractual clauses (Art. 46 para. 2 lit. c) GDPR), express consent or in the case of contractually or legally required transfer (Art. 49 para. 1 GDPR). In addition, we will inform you of the bases for third country transfers for the individual providers from third countries, whereby adequacy decisions take precedence as bases. Information on third country transfers and existing adequacy decisions can be found in the information provided by the EU Commission: <a href="https://commission.europa.eu/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection_en?prefLang=de" target="_blank">https://commission.<wbr>europa.<wbr>eu/<wbr>law/<wbr>law-topic/<wbr>data-protection/<wbr>international-dimension-data-protection_en?<wbr>prefLang=de.</a> Within the framework of the so-called "Data Privacy Framework" (DPF), the EU Commission has also recognised the level of data protection as secure for certain companies from the USA within the framework of the adequacy decision of 10.07.2023. The list of certified companies as well as further information on the DPF can be found on the website of the US Department of Commerce at <a href="https://www.dataprivacyframework.gov/" target="_blank">https://www.dataprivacy<wbr>framework.gov/</a> (in English). We will inform you in the context of the data protection notices which of our service providers used are certified under the Data Privacy Framework.</p>

                <h2 id="m12">General Information on Data Storage and Erasure</h2><p>We erase personal data that we process in accordance with legal requirements as soon as the underlying consents are revoked or there are no other legal bases for the processing. This applies in cases where the original purpose of processing no longer applies or the data is no longer required. Exceptions to this rule exist if legal obligations or special interests require longer storage or archiving of the data.</p>
                <p>In particular, data that must be stored for commercial or tax law reasons or whose storage is necessary for legal prosecution or to protect the rights of other natural or legal persons must be archived accordingly.</p>
                <p>Our data protection notices contain additional information on the storage and erasure of data that apply specifically to certain processing processes.</p>
                <p>If there are several indications of the storage period or erasure periods of a date, the longest period shall always be decisive.</p>
                <p>If a period does not expressly begin on a specific date and is at least one year, it automatically starts at the end of the calendar year in which the event triggering the period occurred. In the case of ongoing contractual relationships in the context of which data is stored, the event triggering the period is the point in time at which the notice of termination becomes effective or other termination of the legal relationship.</p>
                <p>Data that is no longer processed for the originally intended purpose but is stored due to legal requirements or other reasons is processed by us exclusively for the reasons that justify its storage.</p>
                <p><strong>Further information on processing procedures, processes and services:</strong></p><ul class="m-elements"><li><strong>Storage and erasure of data: </strong>The following general deadlines apply to storage and archiving under German law:<ul> <li>10 years - retention period for books and records, annual financial statements, inventories, management reports, opening balance sheet and the working instructions and other organisational documents required for their understanding (Â§ 147 para. 1 no. 1 in conjunction with para. 3 AO, Â§ 14b para. 1 UStG, Â§ 257 para. 1 no. 1 in conjunction with para. 4 HGB).</li><li>8 years - accounting documents, such as invoices and cost receipts (Â§ 147 para. 1 no. 4 and 4a in conjunction with para. 3 sentence 1 AO and Â§ 257 para. 1 no. 4 in conjunction with para. 4 HGB).</li><li>6 years - Other business documents: received commercial or business letters, copies of dispatched commercial or business letters, other documents, insofar as they are relevant for taxation, e.g. hourly wage slips, operating statements, calculation documents, price tags, but also payroll documents, insofar as they are not already accounting documents and till receipts (Â§ 147 para. 1 no. 2, 3, 5 in conjunction with para. 3 AO, Â§ 257 para. 1 no. 2 and 3 in conjunction with para. 4 HGB).</li><li>3 years - Data that is required to take into account potential warranty and claims for damages or similar contractual claims and rights and to process related enquiries, based on previous business experience and common industry practices, are stored for the duration of the regular statutory limitation period of three years (Â§Â§ 195, 199 BGB).</li> </ul></li></ul>

                <h2 id="m328">Plug-ins and Embedded Functions and Content</h2><p>We integrate functional and content elements into our online offer that are obtained from the servers of their respective providers (hereinafter referred to as "third-party providers"). These may be, for example, graphics, videos or city maps (hereinafter uniformly referred to as "content").</p>
                <p>Integration always presupposes that the third-party providers of this content process the IP address of the users, as they could not send the content to their browsers without the IP address. The IP address is therefore required for the presentation of this content or functions. We endeavour to use only such content whose respective providers use the IP address solely for the delivery of the content. Third-party providers may also use so-called pixel tags (invisible graphics, also known as "web beacons") for statistical or marketing purposes. Pixel tags can be used to evaluate information such as visitor traffic on the pages of this website. The pseudonymous information may also be stored in cookies on the user's device and may contain, among other things, technical information about the browser and operating system, referring websites, visiting time and other information on the use of our online offer, but may also be linked to such information from other sources.</p>
                <p><strong>Information on legal bases:</strong> If we ask users for their consent to the use of third-party providers, the legal basis for data processing is permission. Otherwise, user data is processed on the basis of our legitimate interests (i.e. interest in efficient, economic and user-friendly services). In this context, we would also like to draw your attention to the information on the use of cookies in this privacy policy.</p>
                <ul class="m-elements"><li><strong>Types of data processed:</strong> Usage data (e.g. page views and dwell time, click paths, usage intensity and frequency, device types and operating systems used, interactions with content and functions).

Legitimate Interests (Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f) GDPR).</li></ul><p><strong>Further information on processing procedures, processes and services:</strong></p><ul class="m-elements"><li><strong>Google Fonts (Retrieval from Google Server): </strong>Retrieval of fonts (and symbols) for the purpose of technically secure, maintenance-free and efficient use of fonts and symbols with regard to up-to-dateness and loading times, their uniform presentation and consideration of possible licensing restrictions. The IP address of the user is communicated to the font provider so that the fonts can be made available in the user's browser. In addition, technical data (language settings, screen resolution, operating system, hardware used) are transmitted, which are necessary for the provision of the fonts depending on the devices and technical environment used. This data may be processed on a server of the font provider in the USA - When visiting our online offer, users' browsers send their browser HTTP requests to the Google Fonts Web API (i.e. a software interface for retrieving the fonts). The Google Fonts Web API provides users with the Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) from Google Fonts and then the fonts specified in the CCS. These HTTP requests include (1) the IP address used by the respective user to access the Internet, (2) the requested URL on the Google server and (3) the HTTP headers, including the user agent, which describes the browser and operating system versions of the website visitors, as well as the referrer URL (i.e. the website on which the Google font is to be displayed). According to Google, IP addresses are neither logged nor stored on Google servers and are not analysed. The Google Fonts Web API logs details of the HTTP requests (requested URL, user agent and referrer URL). Access to this data is restricted and strictly controlled. The requested URL identifies the font families for which the user wants to load fonts. This data is logged so that Google can determine how often a particular font family is requested. In the Google Fonts Web API, the user agent must adapt the font that is generated for the respective browser type. The user agent is primarily logged for debugging and used to generate aggregated usage statistics that measure the popularity of font families. These aggregated usage statistics are published on the "Analytics" page of Google Fonts. Finally, the referrer URL is logged so that the data can be used for production maintenance and to generate an aggregated report on the top integrations based on the number of font requests. According to its own information, Google does not use any of the information collected by Google Fonts to create profiles of end users or to serve targeted ads; <strong>Service provider:</strong> Google Ireland Limited, Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland; <span class=""><strong>Legal bases:</strong> Legitimate Interests (Art. 6 para. 1 sentence 1 lit. f) GDPR); </span><strong>Website:</strong> <a href="https://fonts.google.com/" target="_blank">https://fonts.google.com/</a>; <strong>Privacy policy:</strong> <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">https://policies.<wbr>google.<wbr>com/<wbr>privacy</a>; <strong>Basis for third-country transfers:</strong> Data Privacy Framework (DPF). <strong>Further information:</strong> <a href="https://developers.google.com/fonts/faq/privacy?hl=de" target="_blank">https://developers.<wbr>google.<wbr>com/<wbr>fonts/<wbr>faq/<wbr>privacy?<wbr>hl=de</a>.</li></ul>
